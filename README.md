# Critflix App

> Criftlix is the most popular web app to write - read articles about the latest netflix's shows. Simply log in to your account and start exploring. This project consists in a simple sessions system with login and signup functionalities. You'll be redirected to the homepage where all categories will be displayed together with the most recent article written in that category. You can click the category section to  browse all articles inside a single category. I also implemented a vote system for the articles where the user can vote just once for each article.
